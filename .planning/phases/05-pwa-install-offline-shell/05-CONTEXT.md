## Implementation Decisions

### Install experience
- Passive install only; no in-app install prompt or button
- App name: "Roasted"
- App icon should match existing app style and show the full name
- Installed app should launch to the inventory screen

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact placement of the install-related guidance entry point
- Microcopy and layout details for install-related UI (within existing style)

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- App name should display in full as "Roasted"
